 ## Credits
 * The background image was generated with leonardo AI (check it out on: https://leonardo.ai/).
 * I have also used chatgpt (check it out on: https://chat.openai.com) to come up with some nice words.
 * I have also used bard to get the text color best suited for the background image since bard has the ability to recognise images.
